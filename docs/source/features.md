# Features

The Jupyter Kernel Gateway has the following features:

- [`jupyter-websocket` mode](websocket-mode.md) which provides a
  Jupyter Notebook server-compatible API for requesting kernels and
  communicating with them using Websockets
- [`notebook-http` mode](http-mode.md) which maps HTTP requests to
  cells in annotated notebooks
- Option to enable other kernel communication mechanisms by plugging in third party personalities
- Option to set a shared authentication token and require it from clients
- Options to set CORS headers for servicing browser-based clients
- Option to set a custom base URL (e.g., for running under tmpnb)
- Option to limit the number kernel instances a gateway server will launch
  (e.g., to force scaling at the container level)
- Option to pre-spawn a set number of kernel instances
- Option to set a default kernel language to use when one is not specified
  in the request
- Option to pre-populate kernel memory from a notebook
- Option to serve annotated notebooks as HTTP endpoints, see
  [notebook-http](http-mode.md)
- Option to allow downloading of the notebook source when running
  in `notebook-http` mode
- Generation of [Swagger specs](http://swagger.io/introducing-the-open-api-initiative/)
  for notebook-defined API in `notebook-http` mode
- A CLI for launching the kernel gateway: `jupyter kernelgateway OPTIONS`
- A Python 3.8+ compatible implementation
