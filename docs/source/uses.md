# Use Cases

The Jupyter Kernel Gateway makes possible the following novel uses of kernels:

- Attach a local Jupyter Notebook server to a compute cluster in the cloud
  running near big data (e.g., interactive gateway to Spark)
- Enable a new breed of non-notebook web clients to provision and use
  kernels (e.g., dashboards using
  [jupyter-js-services](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-js-services))
- Scale kernels independently from clients (e.g., via
  [tmpnb](https://github.com/jupyter/tmpnb), [Binder](http://mybinder.org/),
  or your favorite cluster manager)
- Create microservices from notebooks via
  [`notebook-http` mode](http-mode.md)

The following diagram shows how you might use `tmpnb` to deploy a pool of kernel gateway instances in Docker containers to support on-demand interactive compute:
